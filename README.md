* ### __Overview and Origin:__

Ripple and its RippleNet Platform. Ripple was established in 2012 in San Francisco, Ca. under its original name Opencoin. 
* Founders:

    The founders are [Chris Larsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Larsen)  and [Jed McCaleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jed_McCaleb). Prior to founding Ripple in 2012 Chris Larsen founded E-Loan in 1997 as one of the leaders in online lending and Prosper Market Place a peer to peer online lending platform started in 2005. Jed McCaleb, is a software developer whom prior to founding Ripple was known for the creation of Mt. Gox which was developed to facilitate the trading of a popular card game and ended up becoming a popular exchange for the _[Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin)_ cryptocurrency. 
* The Idea:
    
    Ripple is two things a technology company and a cryptocurrency via the [XRP](https://www.coindesk.com/price/xrp) token. However, in order to differ the company from many other in their realm, neither the technology nor the token were created to decentralize our current banking system. Ripple was created as a solution in order to revamp our current global monetary infrastructure system. The founders saw that our current money system had not changed in decades, the cost of moving money was getting more expensive and taking longer. Using blockchain technology they saw they were able to solve several problems. The speed of money transfer, the excessive cost of transfers and the logistics. Ultimately the goal became to move money as fast as data moves in this day and age.
* Funding:

    Ripple is currently funded by individual investors, Venture Capital Firms, traditional banks, techology companies and trading firms. Top investors in Ripple are CME Ventures a large derivatives trading firm, SBI Holding investments based in Japan, highly ranked venture capoital firms based in California and New York, technology companies like Seagate Technologies which coincidentaly focuses on data storage and traditional banks like Banco Santander and Standard Chartered Bank. Since 2012 funds raised from investors have led the company to have an approximate $10 Billion valuation. The most recent funding came from a Series (C) round in December 2019 where they raised $200 Million led by Tetragon Fianncial Group. 

* ### __Business Activities:__
    
    Ripple is trying to solve two priority issues with our current financial and banking infrastucture using RippleNet.
    - The speed of bank transaction settlement - currently 3 - 5 business days.
    - The cost of bank transactions - $1.6 Trillion annually.

    As perfectly described in the company website the speed of current bank transaction insfrastructure runs at the speed our postal service. The bank transaction system has not changed in decades.A check still takes several days to clear the same goes for a wire transfer in some cases. The cost of a wire transfer is on average $25 - $30 within the US, for funds being transfered outside of the US in any other currency can cost you $45 - $50. 
    - What is the solution? 
    
    Ripple's solution is to speed up the global transaction settle times bot by decentralizing currency or creating a system outside of the currently existing one but by joining the traditional banking system and working with them to update the currently infrastructure technology. Updating the current infrastucture would allow transactions to settle in a matter of seconds or less to and from anywhere in the world. The cost of each transaction would be less than a penny. 
    - How?

    RippleNet uses blockchain technology. Some might argue that Ripple is not using blockchain technology because blockchain is minable and decentralized. Blockchain is a distributed database existing on multiple computers at the same time. It is constantly growing as new sets of recordings or "blocks" are added to it. Each block contains a timestamp and a link to the previous block, so they actually form a chain. One of the main differences between Ripple and its token XRP and traditional blockchain is that the token cannot be mined. The token behind Ripple, XRP is what is used within Ripple's network to transfer currency. Without the ability for it to be mined and in that case not having the ability of arbitrarily creating more tokens Ripple's technology creates a safety net of stability for banks and money transfer agencies around the world as the token wouldn't have the added volatility other tokens/cryptocurrencies have. In other words RippleNet delivers a single, frictionless experience for global payments. It creates a standardized, centralized communication for a global network of banks that send and receive paymetn via Ripple's distributed financial technology providing real time messaging, clearing and settlement of transactions. 
    - How does it work?

    The RippleNet blockchain supports tokens that represent fiat currency, cryptocurrency, commodities and other units of value. It is considered a "Centralized" blockchain which makes it more reliable and fast. See diagram below:

    - The Customer and the unfair advantage:

    The company has over 300 customers and growing that range from traditional banks to foreign exchange companies, cryptocurrency exchanges, payment providers and technology companies. The market size of their customers range from Large cap companies to small cap. At the moment having a main competitor SWIFT, the unfair advantage Ripple has is having the ability to offer speed and low cost of the technology as well as a seamless implementation into their current systems.
